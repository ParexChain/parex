Parex is a decentralized exchange. It also has a token that can only exist through the mining production mechanism. The production network is processed with the DRC-16 protocol. It can also build bridges with many networks thanks to Proof of Interoperability.

Thanks to Parex Proof of Interoperability, it establishes interoperable bridges with other networks. There is a balance between all networks. Circulation is common.

Polygon, BEP20, Ethereum, Polkadot, Avax etc. Burning is common. As soon as the PRX token is sent to production, it is burned and falls out of circulation. It continues its existence as a community oriented project to overcome all difficulties.

The Proof of Interoperability mechanism ensures that the PRX token is an interoperable token in every network. In this way, every inter-network transfer is possible thanks to Parex Market. Switching between networks takes place at low fees and quickly through the Parex Market.

Bridge makes tiring routes easy for PRX.

Parex is a token whose entire supply is in the hands of its users. Distribution progresses through users. Production is done only by users. No PRX is produced outside of production.

Click on ‘Export Private Key’, confirm with your password and ‘Export as file’. You will download your private key as a CSV file. 

## Step 2
Go on wallet.parity.io. You will have to accept all the terms and conditions and create a Ethereum account. The account you are creating has no importance to this process, but you will have to do it in order to proceed. Once you have created an account, go on the ‘ACCOUNTS’ tab and click ‘+ ACCOUNT’. Select ‘PRIVATE KEY’.

## Step 3
Click on the just imported account and select the ‘EXPORT’ option.
